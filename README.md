# Naive-Bayes-Classifier-for-Spam-Emails 99.22% Accuray

Implementing a Naive Bayes Classifier for classifying emails into Ham and Spam emails.

This project tackles,

* Risk Minimization
* Bayes rule
* Maximum Likelihood Estimation
* Efficient Classifier implimantation based on Naive Bayes Probability computations
* Data cleaning and representation

Via efficient and well built mathematical algorithms and calculations, the Trained classifier reaches a stunning **99.22% accuracy** over 900 Test Data emails!
